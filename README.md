# centr-seek-revised

This project is an extension of a Faculty Assistance in Data Science (FADS) project, CEnTR*SEEK, and will explore and identify approaches to three critical questions/tasks that are foundational for a machine learning-based approach:

  1. How can unstructured texts from diverse sources be processed to create optimal input data for machine learning algorithms in the context of community engaged research projects?
  2. Which machine learning classification techniques provide the best balance between accuracy and interpretability for categorizing community engaged research projects?
  3. What database schema and data storage strategies best facilitate the interoperability, transparency, and scalability of community engaged research project attributes?

By exploring these questions, efforts for identifying and categorizing community engaged and public scholarship will be enhanced.
